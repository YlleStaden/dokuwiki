multiple lines. [This part is bracketed] for emphasis.</promptbox>

==== Example Breakdown ====
- `[Your Custom Title]`: This sets the title of the prompt box.
- `This is a sample prompt text...`: This is the content that will appear as the prompt.
- Bracketed text (e.g., `[This part is bracketed]`) will be highlighted in blue for emphasis.

==== Features ====
- **Custom Title**: You can set the title dynamically for each prompt box.
- **Multi-Line Support**: The plugin handles multi-line prompt text, respecting line breaks.
- **Bracket Highlighting**: Any text inside square brackets will be highlighted in blue.
- **Copy Functionality**: Includes buttons to copy either the prompt text or the URL.
- **Call-to-Action Link**: A link in the lower left corner that defaults to "https://almbok.com/ai/prompts/start" with the message "Learn more about AI Prompt Engineering."

==== Use Case Instructions ====
- **Creating Custom Prompts**: Use the plugin to display prompts or instructions, making it easy for users to copy content.
- **Embedding AI Prompts**: Share prompts related to AI or any other subject, and allow users to copy them with a click.
- **Training Material**: The box is useful for sharing short instructions or training material with easy-to-copy text.

This plugin enhances content sharing and training by allowing dynamic, interactive prompt boxes that encourage user engagement through copy buttons and links.
